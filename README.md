Creating a portfolio website to demonstrate my coding skills

## Description

In this project, I designed a portfolio website featuring sections about myself, showcased some of the work I have done so far and provided contact information for potential colloborations or employment opportunities. The aim of this project is to display the skills and knowledge I have gained since learning HTML/CSS languages in my bootcamp course. This opportunity has allowed me to practice not only designing visually appealing websites but also coding them in a way that ensures responsiveness across various screen sizes. This skill is crucial for my future projects and essential for my overall growth as a web developer.

## Usage
